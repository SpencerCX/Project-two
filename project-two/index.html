           <h1>Bio</h1>
           <p>Hello, my name is Spencer Hall and I plan to earn an Associate degree in Graphic Design at McHenry County College. I am attending my second year at MCC.
              The reason I'm taking Web Design is that I wish to get better at doing online art on websites. 
              I've always been interested in learning about building and designing websites to get an advertising job or a marketing job. </p>

           <p>I became interested in digital art when I was a sophomore and enjoyed using the tools in graphic design one class. Since then, I have gotten better by learning more in the classes I have taken. </p>
