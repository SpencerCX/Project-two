           <p>Shown on this page are five of the projects that I completed in Color Theory class this semester.</p>
           <h2>Project 1</h2>
           <p>The first project I did was about Hue studies. This focused on the primary colors red, yellow, and blue. Each color study shows the transition from dark to light representing shades and tints. I created these by cutting each of the squares from magazines pages.</p>

            <h2>Project 2</h2>
           <p>The second project I did was about the color wheel. This focused on the primary, secondary, and tertiary colors. Each color study shows the transition from dark to light representing shades and tints. I created these by cutting each of the squares from paint chips I got at Menards.</p>
